# 👋 Hi, I'm Anour!

🎓 Senior at City College of New York, majoring in Computer Science  
🔍 Aspiring Data Analyst with a passion for Machine Learning, AI, and solving real-world problems

I enjoy turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. As a Break Through Tech AI Fellow, I've been developing my skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence through Cornell-led courses, collaborative projects, and mentorship. I thrive in spaces where I can learn fast, contribute meaningfully, and keep growing — both technically and professionally.

Right now, I'm especially focused on building ML models, improving my data storytelling, and exploring opportunities in data analytics and AI. I'm actively looking for internship opportunities to apply and sharpen these skills — feel free to reach out if you know of any!

## ⚡ Fun Fact:
I love the calm of the countryside and enjoy playing chess and GeoGuessr when I’m not coding. Strategy and curiosity — on the board or in data — are my favorite combo.
